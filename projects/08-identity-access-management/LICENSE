                    IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT SECURITY NOTICES
===============================================================================

CRITICAL SECURITY DISCLAIMERS:

1. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
   This project involves identity and access management systems that control
   access to sensitive resources and personal data. These systems are critical
   security infrastructure components that require:
   - Secure deployment in isolated environments
   - Proper security hardening and configuration
   - Regular security updates and patch management
   - Comprehensive monitoring and audit logging
   - Compliance with applicable privacy and security regulations

2. AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION TESTING
   The authentication and authorization testing tools included in this project
   must only be used:
   - In authorized test environments with proper approval
   - Against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
   - In compliance with organizational security policies
   - Following responsible disclosure practices for vulnerabilities
   - With appropriate legal authorization and documentation

3. PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT (PAM)
   The PAM components handle highly privileged credentials and access controls:
   - PAM vaults store critical system and application passwords
   - Privileged session recording captures sensitive administrative activities
   - Break-glass procedures bypass normal security controls
   - Emergency access mechanisms require strict governance
   - All PAM activities must be monitored and audited

4. PERSONAL DATA AND PRIVACY PROTECTION
   Identity management systems process personal and sensitive information:
   - User credentials, profiles, and authentication data
   - Biometric data for advanced authentication methods
   - Behavioral analytics and access pattern data
   - Audit logs containing detailed user activity information
   - Cross-system identity federation data

   - Hardware tokens require proper enrollment and management
   - Biometric data must be handled with extreme care

2. SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) SECURITY
   - SAML assertion manipulation requires authorized testing environment
   - OAuth token interception must be conducted ethically
   - Session replay attacks should only be performed on test systems
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) testing requires proper scope
   - Identity provider trust relationships affect multiple systems

3. DIRECTORY SERVICE SECURITY
   - LDAP injection attacks must be limited to authorized test environments
   - Kerberoasting attacks require explicit authorization
   - Golden ticket attacks can compromise entire domains
   - Directory enumeration should respect privacy and authorization
   - Privilege escalation testing must be carefully scoped
