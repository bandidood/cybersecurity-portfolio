                          SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE NOTICES
===============================================================================

IMPORTANT SECURITY DISCLAIMERS:

1. EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY
   This project is designed exclusively for educational, research, and 
   authorized testing purposes in controlled laboratory environments. Any 
   use in production environments requires thorough security assessment and 
   compliance validation.

2. WIRELESS SECURITY TESTING
   All wireless security testing tools and techniques provided in this project
   must only be used:
   - In isolated test environments
   - With proper authorization from network owners
   - In compliance with local and federal laws
   - Following responsible disclosure practices

3. PENETRATION TESTING RESTRICTIONS
   The wireless penetration testing tools included are intended for:
   - Authorized security assessments only
   - Testing of your own networks and systems
   - Educational demonstration in controlled environments
   - Compliance validation and security audits

   UNAUTHORIZED USE of these tools against networks you do not own or lack
   explicit written permission to test may violate local, state, and federal
   laws including but not limited to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
   and similar international legislation.

4. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with:
   - Local wireless communication regulations
   - FCC regulations (United States)
   - Industry-specific compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
   - International wireless standards (IEEE 802.11, WiFi Alliance)
   - Data protection and privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

5. ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT
   Before deploying this solution in any production environment:
   - Conduct thorough security assessments
   - Validate compliance with organizational security policies
   - Perform comprehensive testing in isolated environments
   - Ensure all configurations meet security requirements
   - Document all security controls and monitoring procedures

SPECIFIC WIRELESS SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. WPA3 IMPLEMENTATION
   - WPA3 security features require compatible hardware and software
   - Legacy device compatibility may require WPA3-Transition modes
   - Regular security updates are essential for maintaining protection
   - Certificate management requires robust PKI infrastructure

2. RADIUS AND AUTHENTICATION
   - RADIUS server security is critical for overall wireless security
   - Certificate-based authentication requires proper key management
   - Regular security audits of authentication infrastructure recommended
   - Monitoring and logging of all authentication events is essential

3. NETWORK SEGMENTATION
   - VLAN segmentation must be properly configured and maintained
   - Regular validation of network isolation is required
   - Access control policies require periodic review and updates
   - Guest network isolation must be thoroughly tested and monitored

4. MONITORING AND DETECTION
   - Wireless intrusion detection systems require regular tuning
   - False positive management is critical for operational efficiency
   - Incident response procedures must be regularly tested and updated
   - Security event correlation requires proper SIEM integration
