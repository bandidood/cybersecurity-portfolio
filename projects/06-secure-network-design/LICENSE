IMPORTANT SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE DISCLAIMER:

This project contains network security designs, configurations, and tools 
intended for educational, training, and controlled testing environments only.

USERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR:

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring all usage complies with applicable laws, 
   regulations, and organizational policies in their jurisdiction.

2. **Security Review**: Conducting thorough security assessments before 
   implementing any designs, configurations, or tools in production environments.

3. **Risk Management**: Understanding and accepting all risks associated with 
   network security implementations, including but not limited to:
   - Network disruption or downtime
   - Security vulnerabilities or exposures  
   - Compliance violations
   - Data loss or unauthorized access

4. **Professional Consultation**: Seeking appropriate professional cybersecurity 
   and legal consultation for production deployments.

5. **Testing Environment**: Using only controlled, isolated testing environments 
   that do not impact production systems or networks.

6. **Data Protection**: Ensuring no sensitive, personal, or proprietary data is 
   used in testing scenarios or exposed in configurations.

7. **Network Authorization**: Obtaining proper authorization before testing 
   network security controls on any network infrastructure.

PROHIBITED USES:

- Testing against networks without explicit written authorization
- Using configurations or tools for malicious purposes
- Deploying in production without proper security review and testing
- Violating privacy laws or data protection regulations
- Circumventing security controls in unauthorized environments

COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORKS:

This project references and implements controls from various compliance frameworks
including NIST, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS. Implementation of these controls does not
guarantee compliance. Organizations must conduct their own compliance assessments
and work with qualified auditors to achieve certification.

NETWORK SECURITY NOTICE:

The network designs and configurations in this project implement defense-in-depth
security controls following Zero Trust principles. However, security is an ongoing
process requiring:

- Regular security assessments and updates
- Continuous monitoring and threat detection
- Proper incident response procedures
- Regular training and awareness programs
- Professional security management

NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES:

The authors provide no warranties regarding the security effectiveness, compliance
status, or operational reliability of any designs, configurations, or tools
provided in this project.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

For questions regarding appropriate use, please consult with qualified 
cybersecurity professionals and legal counsel.
