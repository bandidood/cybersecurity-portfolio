# Zero Trust Architecture Design

## 🛡️ Zero Trust Network Security Model

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the Zero Trust architecture implementation for the secure network design project, following NIST SP 800-207 guidelines and industry best practices. The Zero Trust model assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every transaction and access request.

### Zero Trust Principles

#### Core Tenets
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All users, devices, and network flows are authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal access rights are granted for the minimum time necessary
3. **Assume Breach**: Security posture assumes attackers are present in the environment
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Authentication and authorization are based on all available data points
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and behavioral analysis of all activities
