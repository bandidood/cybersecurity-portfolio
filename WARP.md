### Project Architecture Pattern
Each project follows a consistent structure:
```
project-xx-name/
├── README.md          # Detailed project documentation  
├── CHANGELOG.md       # Version history and updates
├── scripts/           # Automation and deployment scripts
├── configs/           # Configuration files and templates
├── docs/              # Technical documentation
├── evidence/          # Screenshots, logs, reports (anonymized)
└── tests/             # Validation and security tests
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All logs, captures, and evidence are sanitized and anonymized
- `.gitignore` prevents committing sensitive files (credentials, PII, real network captures)
- Test data only - no production or client information
- VM isolation ensures contained testing environment

### Operational Security
- Network segments isolated from production environments
- Default credentials must be changed before deployment
- Regular security updates and patching required
- Monitoring and logging enabled for all activities

### Compliance Standards
Projects align with industry frameworks:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk management and security controls
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management
- **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security standards  
- **CIS Controls** - Critical security controls implementation

### Testing and Validation
- Each project includes validation tests and acceptance criteria
- Security testing performed in isolated environments only
- Performance benchmarks and success metrics defined
- Regular health checks and monitoring implemented

### Version Control Best Practices
- Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Feature branches for major project additions  
- No sensitive data in commit history
- Regular documentation updates with code changes
